This directory contains Latex files for 4th year projects

You should run pdflatex on the file Report.tex
(You need to run it twice to get the table of contents correct).

You will need to edit the preamble to set 
Your Name 
Project Title
Uncomment the relevant module (MA4K8 or MA4K9)
Set the correct submission year, e.g. replace 2000 with 2017


There are many things in the preamble you may find useful. Uncomment as
necessary.

Then you should generate the body of your report in files like the examples:
Introduction.tex 
Conclusion.tex 
The files have comments and should be self explanatory.
